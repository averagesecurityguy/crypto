Crypto
======
I've been wanting to write some crypto related code for a while but I didn't want to roll my own crypto. A friend of mine has been talking about libsodium for a while, so I decided to give it a try. If you want to learn more about libsodium and how to use it in your code start here, http://doc.libsodium.org/index.html.
